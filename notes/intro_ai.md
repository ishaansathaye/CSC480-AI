## Intro to AI

## AI Landscape
- Artificial Intelligence
    - Search
    - Reasoning
    - Knowledge Representation
    - Semantic Modeling
        - Treasure
        - Ontologies
        - Real Data
- Machine Learning
    - Artificial Neural Networks
    - Deep Learning
    - Decision Trees
    - Probabilistic Learning

## Hierarchy
- Wisdom -> making the right choice
- Knowledge -> actionable information
- Information -> related data
- Data

## Trying to define AI
- Cognitive approach
    - emphasis on the way systems work or think
- Behavioral approach
    - activities observed are from the outside are taken into account only
- Human-like systems
    - emulate human intelligence
- Rational systems
    - systems that do the right thing

## Turing Test
- provide an operational definition of intelligent behavior
- ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks
- computer is interrogated by a human via a teletype
- Basic Capabilities for passing test
    - NLP -> communicate with interrogator
    - Knowledge representation -> store info
    - Automated Reasoning -> answer questions, draw conclusions
    - ML -> adapt behavior, detect patterns
